    <h3>Last Update</h3>

    The time that the previous Consistency Check finished.

    <h3>Site Name</h3>

    Name of the site as stored in PhEDEx and DDM.

    <h3>Time [min]</h3>

    The amount of time for the entire check to finish.
    A check includes the following steps.
    Each takes at least a minute, though the first step is generally much longer:

    <ul>
      <li>
        Generate a listing of the site contents.
        For most sites, this takes the majority of the time.
        Listings are also cached for a few days,
        so the contribution from this step may be low at times due to interactive tests.
      <li>
        Get the site contents according to dynamo database,
        (which is a basically faster MySQL copy of PhEDEx).
      <li>
        Hash the contents of both listings for speedy comparisons.
        This hashing takes a couple of minutes for each (remote and dynamo) directory tree.
      <li>
        Compare the trees and enter inconsistencies into our registry.
    </ul>

    <h3>Number Files</h3>

    This is the total number of files that were confirmed as existing at the site.
    They were each successfully identified by an XRootD call.

    <h3>Number Nodes</h3>

    This the total number of directories that are included in the listing.
    They are the "internal" nodes of the trees to compare.
    (I'll call files "external" nodes. You'll see why these are in quotes in a second.)

    <h3>Empty Nodes</h3>

    The number of directories that have no files in them.
    That is, this is how many "internal" nodes are not parents, grandparents, etc. of any "external" files nodes.
    (If you're picky that means the lowest level directories themselves are external nodes.)

    <h3>Num Missing</h3>

    Number of files that appear to be missing at the site.
    The links labels "blocks" shows a summary of the number of files missing from each block containing missing files.
    The other link is just a list of file LFNs that are missing.

    <h3>No Source</h3>

    Number of missing files that are not supposed to be on disk at any other site, according to PhEDEx.
    These files must be recovered using tape copies.
    The link is a list of file LFNs that are missing.

    <h3>Num Orphan</h3>

    The number of files that exist at a site that PhEDEx does not know about.
    These files can be deleted.
    The link is a list of file LFNs that are orphans.

    <h3>Size [TB]</h3>

    There are two columns with this heading.
    The first time shows the reported collective size of files that are missing.
    The second time shows the spaced used by orphan files that can be recovered through deletion.
